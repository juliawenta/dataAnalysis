# dataAnalysis

This repository contains an university project, in which we were working with data sets.
The data set on which we worked was a data set containing information about air quality, collected every hour for a year (March 2004 - February 2005) through a multi-sensor device.
Source of the data was: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality
The motivation of our work was acquiring the skills to process, analyze and model data. 
We also aimed to better understand Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
The goal was also to learn more about the topic of air quality.
